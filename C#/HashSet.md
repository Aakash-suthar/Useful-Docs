HashSet in C# with Examples

In C#, HashSet is an unordered collection of unique elements. This collection is introduced in .NET 3.5. 
It supports the implementation of sets and uses the hash table for storage. 
This collection is of the generic type collection and it is defined under System.Collections.Generic namespace. 
**It is generally used when we want to prevent duplicate elements from being placed in the collection.**
The performance of the HashSet is much better in comparison to the list.
